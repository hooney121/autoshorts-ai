Hello, my name is Iriam from YouTube. Today, I would like to talk to you about the current situation in the education system in New Zealand.

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,760
Recently, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a report on the current situation in the education system in South Korea.

Is it true? Yes, it is true. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a report on the current situation in the education system in South Korea.

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,760
Also, some students have not been able to attend their classes because of the current situation.

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,000
The best teachers who will assist them are those who are more well-fëŠ¥ed.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,220
This is not a plotting, but a process that LGBT people need to face.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,619
A positive opportunity has been opened for existence of LGBT people.

8
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:40,900
Students who are involved in their education process need to employ feminine, black and brown women for this purpose.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,820
Many of the talented teachers and women who have a position of learning will be trained to become LGBT people.
